<p> Log initial conversation:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>What if you’ve had this and then they’re ready for the migration notice? Is there a way to link this to the readiness conversation?</li>
</ul>

<p> Readiness conversation:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Readiness to move – if select no – got confused why it said ‘readiness to move’ again. Expected to see something like ‘review readiness’ or something along those lines to highlight more that they haven’t been ready but may be after</li>
</ul>

<p> Migration notice:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li> Useful, no problems going through – the date is the key thing she needs so was all good “I’d just go off and add this date to the letter”</li>
  <li>Ideally want it in the system (so gave Sarah a sneak peek of 2b) and she was super happy as was something mentioned spontaneously to save time</li>
</ul>

<p> Reminders:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Visit could be an option</li>
  <li>Ideally want it in the system (so gave Sarah a sneak peek of 2b) Also there were some concerns over saving and changing templates which has happened in the past (but she was thinking when this scales up – it will be fine for day one)</li>
</ul>

<p> Extension notice:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>  Envisage it being done the same – process wise - as the migration notice and cancellation notice</li>
  <li>Would wait until the last moment to do this. E.g. John Doe tells Sarah he is going in to hospital in 3 weeks for 6 weeks, then Sarah would wait until the last appointment/moment to extend. She may do it there and then and keep extending but more likely to the former</li>
</ul>

<p> Log claim made:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Confusion over this wording, driven by the fact it didn’t have UC in the title – “I don’t understand this, is this that the claim has been submitted by the claimant? It’s not clear”</li>
</ul>

<p> Complete:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Confusion over this, as in her mind it was that legacy had been shut down, so didn’t know what this was about</li>
  <li>Upon probing when she thought it might end, “it would be after the first AP, that’s when TP and payments are done”</li>
</ul>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>If work coaches had the ability to record when an inital discussion about UC took place then they would know when to progress that conversation further becuase they have traceability.</li>
  <li>If work coaches were able to record when a claimant is and isn't ready to receive a Migration Notice then they can manage the claimants needs effectively because they have traceability of their circumstances.</li>
  <li>If a claimant had a change in circumstances the work coach needs the ability to record this because they need to know when to review the case.</li>
  <li>If work coaches have the ability to record when they have reminded a claimant then it provides reassurance because it allows traceability when the reminder has been issued and in what method.</Li>
