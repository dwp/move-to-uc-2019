    <li>Work coaches prefer to treat couples as single journeys because they are individuals</li>
    <li>Especially important if the claimants have different work coaches and for security purposes</li>
    <li>Confirmation of main claimant meaning - usually person who is paid</li>
    <li>There is, however, a need to easily identify a partner through the system - comparisons to current LMS and UC ‘switch’ function. This also tested well in the prototype</li>
    <li>To ensure the journey is linear, prompts on the success page to then populate partner details were well liked - it makes the journey easier.
      Our users really liked it and it helped them though this process. It made it easier for them, which is a key user need.</li>
    <li>Cancelling a journey – there is an expectation that cancelling one person out of the journey would automatically cancel the other (check feasibility with Paul Brennan – he
      mentioned it was better from a data POV to keep them separate if possible). Cancelling a journey – sensitive information cannot be displayed on the partner record (e.g. cancelled due to partner reasons vs showing their partner went in to prison). We need further research on this</li>
      <li>Making a claim – this is where the claim becomes one UC claim (one cannot be submitted without another)</li>
      <li>If the partners broke up after he migration notice – when they go back in to the journey as a single claim, they would like to see the history that it was a previous couple claim. This will help work coaches provide better support to the claimant as they know their background</li>
      <li>Lead claimant/partner terminology. There is a need to understand who the main claimant is, as they are the ones who get paid</li>
