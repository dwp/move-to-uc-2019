  <li>If work coaches had the ability to record when an inital discussion about UC took place then they would know when to progress that conversation further becuase they have traceability.</li>
  <li>If work coaches were able to record when a claimant is and isn't ready to receive a Migration Notice then they can manage the claimants needs effectively because they have traceability of their circumstances.</li>
  <li>If a claimant had a change in circumstances the work coach needs the ability to record this because they need to know when to review the case.</li>
  <li>If work coaches have the ability to record when they have reminded a claimant then it provides reassurance because it allows traceability when the reminder has been issued and in what method.</Li>
